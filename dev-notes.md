- Update PHP display code (clean up gross copy/pasted code)
- Set up cheap and insecure connection to MySql (password is in PHP file ü§î)
- Error; Hmmmm
- Password on database seems to be wrong
- Shell into Docker image for database
- Verify that database set in docker-compose.yml is not correct
- Well, it was correct, but I wrote "localaccess", which included the quotes in the password ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Rebuild db image (otherwise the new password isn't picked up...)
- All right. Docker doesn't want to pick up the new password
- Moving on...
- I'll have to create the schema manually in PHPMyAdmin because the shell script didn't like the quotes in the password
- OK. Halfway through the time. Let's make sure we get it done, then make it pretty
- Everything goes in the index.php until we have functional coverage
- Finished getting prices
- Fixed up page formatting a bit
- Now for storing...
- Storage done
